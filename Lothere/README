         LOTHERE LIGHTING MOD for TS2 (requires Seasons)
                 version 0.01 - Nov. 24 2011

This set of files is an add-on to Gunmod's Radiance Lighting and
Almighty Hat's World Lit By Fire extension.

These are some of the lighting settings that I use for 
illustrating my Sims 2 story at http://www.lothere.com/

This package should be considered experimental and unsupported
because I am constantly modifying it for my own needs.

It overrides a lot of in-game lights to make them look like 
candlelight, since many CC candles are derived from EAxis lights
that aren't candles.  So you may not want to use it if you 
frequently play modern hoods as well as pre-electricity hoods.

It is recommended more for storytellers and picture-takers than
for game-players because it is...

                    -**  VERY VERY DARK. **-

You will find yourself tripling the number of candles and lamps
in your houses, because IT IS VERY VERY DARK.

However, it's easy to remove from your game if you don't like it,
and you can disable and reenable it while the game is open.

I am also almost positive (though I will not guarantee) that it
will not break your game.  If there's an "error" in these files,
the game will just skip them.

I. Light Parameter Overrides

This set contains several files that override certain settings 
in Radiance lighting. These files end in .txt, and they are named
after the files whose settings they replace, e.g. 
Lothere-LightKelvin.txt overrides settings in RLS-LightKelvin.txt.

This way you don't need to overwrite the Radiance/AWLBF files,
and you can easily enable/disable the entire Lothere lighting mod.

II. Individual Lamp Overrides

It also contains a file that selectively changes the lighting
parameters for certain individual lights.  This file is called
Lothere-Individual_Overrides.nlo.  This file is optional. (I will
explain how to enable it or not below.)  Some of the candles will 
be more dramatic with it, and I override some lamps to change 
their color completely.  (For instance, the Moroccan-style table 
lamp now casts a red light because I only use that lantern with 
the red glass anyway.)

III. Lot Lighting Files

Finally, I include one (or more) files that can be used with
the "setLotLightingFile" cheat to *totally* change the lights on
a lot for dramatic effect.  These files end in .lot.  For instance
Night.lot makes an almost pitch black night inside and outside.
Great for pictures, horrible for playing or decorating.

                          INSTALLATION

###################################################################

1. Go to http://hat-plays-sims.dreamwidth.org/18044.html and
   follow Hat's instructions to install Radiance Lighting and 
   Hat's own A World Lit By Fire mod.  She explains this process 
   very well.

2. Extract the contents of the Lothere_Lighting_Mod.rar file.
   It should contain one folder called "Lothere".  Inside that
   folder, there should be several files that have the file
   extensions .nlo, .txt, and .lot, as well as this README file.

3. Copy the ENTIRE "Lothere" folder to your Lights folder, namely:

     C:/Program Files/EA Games/The Sims 2/TSData/Res/Lights 

   This is the same place where you installed Radiance Lighting.

   If you do this correctly, your Lights folder should contain
   a folder called "Lothere" along with some game folders
   called "cas", "LightRigs", "objects", "windows", and maybe
   others.

   You do *not* want to copy the *contents* of the Lothere folder
   to the Lights folder.  (My instructions will not work if you
   do.)  The files should all live in their own folder. It will
   be easier to update or uninstall this way, too.

4. If you *only* want to use the individual lot lighting (.lot) 
   files, you don't need to do anything else.  If you want the 
   full effect of this lighting mod, you have to tell Radiance 
   Lighting to load it.  Here's how:

   Using Notepad, open the file "RLS-Main.txt" that is in your
   Lights folder.

   Towards the very beginning, right after the line 
   "setf wPenMul  20", you should add the following line (on a 
   line of its own):


   wildInclude "Lothere/*.txt"

   
   This will enable the main light parameter overrides (section
   I. above).  It must come before all the "include "RLS-Blah.txt"
   lines in this file, otherwise it won't do very much at all.
   (That is, it must be read before the Radiance Lighting RLS 
   files.)
   
   If you also want the individual overrides (section II. above):
   then scroll to the very bottom of the file, and below the section
   heading "Custom Lights" add the following line:
   
   
   wildInclude "Lothere/*.nlo"

                             USAGE

###################################################################

Now start your game.  If you have successfully followed the above 
steps, a room without windows should be VERY VERY DARK, and most
of your candles should cast a light that is quite orange instead
of Hat's pale gold.

If you are horrified and want to disable it, you do not have to
quit your game to do so.  ALT-TAB away from the game and open the
RLS-Main.txt file in Notepad.  Put a "#" symbol in front of the
two lines that you just added.  This will disable them.

Now, switch back to the game and tell it to reload the lights. 
Bring up the cheat window with SHIFT+CTRL+C and type the following
cheat:

setLotLightingFile clear

This will reload all the lighting files, and since the Lothere
files are now disabled, you should have your ordinary 
Radiance/AWLBF lighting back.

You can switch back and forth this way whenever you want while the
game is running.  For example, do your building with the Lothere
lighting mod disabled, and switch it on to take your pictures.
(After you hurriedly add a ton more candles, because you discover
how dark it is.)

To use the Lot Lighing Files (the ones that end in .lot) you also
use the setLotLightingFile cheat.  But instead of "clear" you would
type something like this:

setLotLightingFile Lothere\Night.lot

(Note that this cheat does not seem to reliably work when it's 
actually nighttime in-game.  I take all my nighttime chapters 
during the game day, using the Night.lot file.  I use a buyable 
sky to hide the bright Sims sky.)

When you are done with the "Night.lot" settings, you can type:

setLotLightingFile clear

again, and that will put you back to the regular lighting.

                       HOW TO UNINSTALL

###################################################################

1. Remove the "include" lines you added to RLS-Main.txt.  See step 
   4 in the instructions above.  Or, just get the original
   RLS-Main.txt file from Radiance Lighting and overwrite your file.
   
2. Delete the Lothere folder that is in your Lights directory.  See
   step 3 in the instructions above.
   
3. Restart your game, or just use the cheat:

   setLotLightingFile clear

                            HELP!!

I said above that this mod should be considered experimental and
unsupported.  This isn't a nice, tidy, well-documented, ready-for-
prime-time mod like Hat's AWLBF is... it's just me sharing my 
partially completed lighting files after many requests.

However, if you are stumped and need assistance, you can post on 
my forum (http://www.lothere.com/forum), send me a PM at the 
Plumb Bob Keep, or send an email to lighting@lothere.com.
I will help you if I can, but do keep in mind I only have access 
to my game on weekends.

In case it matters, I have all the EPs except for FreeTime and 
the Stuff Packs.  I can't guarantee all this will work if you 
don't have these EPs.  I am almost certain you need Seasons, 
though.

Also, these are *my* game settings, and I won't entertain requests
like "Can you make it a little lighter?" because then it's no good
for me any more.  However, I might be able to explain how you can 
modify *your* files to make things lighter.
